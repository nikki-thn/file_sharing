The Datalink and the physical layer are closedly related  
  DATA LINK LAYER: 
  Data-link layer functions: data framing, attach MAC address, physical address, flow control, error control (regulate the flow of data)
  
  Synchronous Transmission: large block of data of 1500 bytes long, start with a transmission flag and the same flag is used to end og transmission. 
  Asynchronous Transmission: when noise are loud and retransmission is allowed.
  
  Simplex: one way communication (keyboard, monitor)
  Half-duplex: can recieved and send but not at the same time (optic cable)
  Full-Duplex: can received and send at the same time (cable)
  
TRANSMISSION ERRORS:
  Types of Transmission Errors: 
    Noise: 2 types of noises: thermal noises due to EMI (need to put a length to 100m), and random noise (spikes) unexpected jump in electricity. // EMI (Electromagnetic Interference): high power cable interfer the analog signal
    Crosstalk: electrons from cables going opposite directions generates EMI at same time and causes signals to jump to the cable beside, twisted cable to cancel out EMI and reduce crosstalk.
    Jitter: when computers jits out of time
    
Error Correction:
    Backward Correction: receivers asks for reseding the signals
    Forward Correction: redundant data to be corrected on the fly. Errors are detected by parity bits combines with hamming codes to correct data.
    CRC: Cycnical Redudancy Check: based on polynomial alrithmetic to correct data by taking the remainder and add to the reciever computers. Catch errors at 99,99%.

Frame are switch, packet are routers

10 physical link (from switches to routers), 3 data link (from router to router), 1 route

5 things We need to get on the Internet: address for default gateway and subnet mask

IPv6 is 4 times faster. because it simplified the router process.
